## Hi there, I'm Simrin ðŸ‘‹



ðŸ’» I'm a Finance and Data Science graduate from Northeastern University 

ðŸ“ŠFrom managing budgets to building dashboards, Iâ€™ve worked across finance and tech to solve problems and support better decisions. Iâ€™m always looking for the next challenge that pushes me to grow. 

ðŸŽ¯ I'm currently looking for full-time roles in financial analysis, strategy, or FP&A that bring together data, business, and impact.
